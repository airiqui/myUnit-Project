  <h1>Top 3 Players of this Era.</h1>
  <img src="mlblogo.png">
  <p>There has been great palyers since the season of 2019 started, for me these are the three more consistant and
    better players scince. Starting off with Mike Trout, Trout has constantly been ranked high in the best players list
    each year. Next on the list I think is the veteran Freddie Freeman, Freeman is a great offense and defence player.
    And last on my list is the young Juan Soto, Soto in his young carrer in the mlb has been an outstanding player in
    2021 he was ranked 3rd and in 2020 he was top 20. </p>
